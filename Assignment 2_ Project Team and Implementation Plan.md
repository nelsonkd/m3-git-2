# **Description of the problem you are trying to solve**

The problem we're tackling is the disconnect between individuals and the evolving job market. This disconnect leads to several issues:

* **For Students:** High schoolers often lack the resources to make informed decisions about college majors or career paths, leading to potential wasted time and money on unsuitable education.  
* **For Career Changers:** Individuals seeking new careers struggle to identify roles that align with their existing skills, hindering efficient job searching and career transitions.  
* **For Educational Institutions:** Trade schools and universities may find it challenging to keep their curriculum aligned with the skills demanded by emerging industries, potentially leaving graduates ill-prepared for the workforce.  
* This project aims to bridge this gap by creating a tool that:  
  * **Empowers individuals** to make data-driven decisions about their education and career paths.  
  * **Facilitates efficient career transitions** by matching existing skills to in-demand jobs.  
  * **Enables educational institutions** to adapt their curriculum to meet future workforce needs.  
* By addressing these issues, we aim to promote better alignment between individual skills and labor market demands, leading to more fulfilling careers and a more efficient workforce.

# A list of basic functionality aka basic features (at least one per team member)

* **Interactive Skill Matching:** Interactive Skill Matching allows users to input their skills and interests, then matches them with relevant occupations and educational paths. This dynamic tool helps users explore career options and identify potential skill gaps they may need to address.  
* **Occupation Exploration:** Occupation Exploration provides detailed insights into various occupations, including required skills, projected growth, and potential salary ranges. This feature enables users to research potential career paths and make informed decisions.  
* **Personalized Skills Development Roadmap:** Personalized Skills Development Roadmap creates a tailored plan for users to acquire the necessary skills for their target occupation, including recommendations for courses, certifications, and other learning resources. This feature helps users bridge their skill gaps and enhance their employability.

# A list of nice-to-have functionality aka nice-to-have features (at least one per team member)

* **Educational Pathway Guidance:** Educational Pathway Guidance makes recommendations on potential educational paths, including college majors and vocational programs, based on a user's chosen career interests and skillset. This helps users identify programs that will best prepare them for their desired field.  
* **Regional Workforce Analysis:** Regional Workforce Analysis allows users to explore skill demands and occupation trends within specific geographic areas. This feature helps individuals and institutions understand local labor market dynamics and make informed decisions based on regional needs.  
* **Policy Recommendation Generation:** Policy Recommendation Generation analyzes skills gaps and future workforce needs to suggest policy recommendations, such as developing targeted education programs or workforce development initiatives.

# A paragraph about the challenges you anticipate. There should be at least three challenges listed:

## a technical challenge you foresee (e.g. do you know all the technologies you would need): 

We anticipate several challenges in this project. One key technical challenge will be efficiently processing and analyzing the extensive BLS datasets. These datasets contain detailed information on numerous occupations and skills, requiring robust data handling and analysis techniques. We'll need to explore appropriate tools and libraries, potentially including Python's Pandas and NumPy, to effectively manage and analyze this data. Additionally, developing accurate skill-matching algorithms and generating insightful policy recommendations will require careful consideration of various factors and potential biases within the data. We'll need to ensure our algorithms are robust, transparent, and provide meaningful results for users across different backgrounds and career goals. 

## a challenges regarding your process (e.g. what could make collaborating difficult): 

Regarding our process, a potential challenge lies in effectively coordinating tasks and maintaining consistent communication throughout the project. As this is a collaborative effort, clear division of responsibilities and regular updates will be crucial to ensure smooth progress and avoid duplication of effort. Differing schedules and potential variations in technical expertise could also pose challenges to our collaboration. We'll need to establish clear communication channels and address any roadblocks promptly.

* **Scheduling Meetings:** Finding a time to meet and work together synchronously can be tricky when one person is starting their day while the other is finishing. This could limit opportunities for real-time brainstorming and problem-solving.  
* **Communication Delays:** With a significant time difference, responses to messages and questions might be delayed, slowing down progress and potentially creating frustration.  
* **Unequal Workload Distribution:** If one person is consistently available while the other is constrained by their work schedule, it could lead to an uneven distribution of tasks and potentially resentment.

## a challenge regarding the team composition or available skills (e.g. a large discrepancy in skills):

While our team possesses a strong balance of technical and non-technical skills, with Ken's expertise in software development complementing Dianna's experience in research and design, potential challenges related to our team composition exist. Ken's advanced programming skills may lead to an uneven distribution of coding tasks, potentially limiting Dianna's learning and contribution. Furthermore, differences in technical proficiency could occasionally hinder communication and create misunderstandings. To mitigate these challenges, we will prioritize knowledge sharing and open communication, ensuring both members actively participate in all project phases and contribute their unique expertise.

# **A paragraph about how you plan to work together and communicate as a team (e.g., do you plan to meet on Zoom to work on your project or individually while communicating via Slack?):** 

To foster effective collaboration and communication, we plan to implement a multi-faceted approach. We will hold two formal Zoom meetings per week on weekdays at 6:00 PM PST to accommodate our time zone differences, ensuring dedicated time for synchronous discussion and collaborative work. A brief check-in will be scheduled on Saturdays to maintain momentum, with final reviews conducted on Sundays. For quick questions and informal discussions, we will utilize iMessage, while longer discussions and document reviews will be conducted via email. This combination of scheduled meetings and flexible communication channels will ensure consistent interaction and facilitate efficient progress throughout the project.
